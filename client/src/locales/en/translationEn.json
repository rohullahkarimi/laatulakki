At first, the student cap was worn only by men and women only wore a lyre, until their own cap was designed for them at the end of the 19th century. However, this cap did not remain in use. The student cap was still used as a summer headgear in the 1950s, until its use decreased to match today.",

    "capUsage4": "Perhaps you have seen your grandparents' yellowed student cap? The traces of life and yellowing are part of the student cap's life cycle, but the cap can also be cleaned if you wish by lightly brushing it with a velvet brush or with a piece of foam and a stain remover. However, the cap should be kept in its own box, as it protects the yo-yo cap from dust. You can wipe fingerprints from the magazine with a clean cotton cloth or a neutral cloth moistened with soapy water. However, the student cap should not be washed in the washing machine or soaked. If your student cap does get wet, let it dry for a day at room temperature before putting it in the box.",

    "our_story2": "Rohullah Karimi, the founder and CEO of Laatulak, was born in Afghanistan, where he has seen that education is not a given or even an option for everyone. After arriving in Finland as an asylum seeker, he noticed that there are almost limitless opportunities for studying in Finland and the opportunity to create the life he wants, when on the other hand, in his home country, the future of many young people, especially girls, is not in their own hands. Karimi soon learned the Finnish language and quickly studied for a professional and university of applied sciences degree and got a job in his field. However, Karimi had long had the idea of his own business and wanted a way to help people with it with help. The idea of selling student caps was born. Starting a small business from scratch included both ups and downs. You had to find a reliable manufacturer for the caps, figure out how to stand out from the competition, fill out a big pile of different papers and find an effective marketing method so that the consumer at would find us. We have learned a lot on this journey and we are grateful for everything. We want to offer our buyers only the best and we want to make them feel that they are special.",
    "our_story3": "Because of Karim's own background, the opportunity to study is particularly important to us. We can be grateful that in Finland we all have the same opportunities to study and train in the field we want. Studying should be a human right and possible for everyone around the world, regardless of their gender or background. This is why we want to help those who are not as lucky and through the Red Cross we donate 5% of our annual income to support the teaching and education of children in developing countries. These children have the opportunity to change the direction of their own future and at the same time positively affect other people's lives as well, but they need help to do that, that's why this project is especially close to our hearts.",
    "our_story4": "Education is the most effective way to change the world, so let's celebrate it appropriately. Each of us is unique and valuable and everyone deserves to know that. Graduation parties are the highlight of the early summer for many young people, and hard work with textbooks is rewarded when you can celebrate your own success with family and friends to celebrate. We want to make your celebration day special, that's why every cap bought from us is made and packaged beautifully just for you.",
